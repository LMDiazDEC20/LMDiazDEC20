- 👋 Hi, I’m @LMDiazDEC20
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to tinker with Rasperry Pi modules and how to identify & correct progamming errors (that I probably caused to begin with). 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Masters in Education at Penn State & working fulltime as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from you guys that know what you're doing. 
- 📫 I can be reached at emailmanueldiaz@yahoo.com, but please, I don't need an extended warranty on my car and I'm not falling for that whole gift-card thing again :-)
